# 🚀 VibeUI — Build Beautiful Interfaces Just by Chatting

Hackathon Project — Mini Vibe Coding Hackathon
Have you ever wished you could design a full user interface without writing endless lines of code? What if you could simply describe your idea in plain English and see a UI appear instantly?

That’s exactly what we built at the Mini Vibe Coding Hackathon:
👉 VibeUI — a Chat-to-UI Designer.

🎯 Key Features
1. ✅ Build dashboards, forms, cards, and charts from simple text prompts
2. ✅ Live preview of generated UI
3. ✅ Export-ready code for developers
4. ✅ Example prompts for quick demos (login form, profile card, sidebar layout)
5. ✅ Clean, responsive design

“Chat your vibe, see your UI.”
