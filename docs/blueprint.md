- Export Option: Provide a button to export the generated code as a .jsx file for further use.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated teal (#46D9C3) to convey a modern, fresh and dynamic feel.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F3F5), almost white, for a clean, spacious feel that is easy on the eyes.
- Accent color: Blue (#52B6DF), slightly desaturated to provide clear visual contrast, while maintaining a balanced, professional tone.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean and modern aesthetic, perfect for both headings and body text. 
- Simple and clear icons that are easy to understand. Consistent style throughout the application. Use of a feather icon set would be ideal.
- Card-based design with rounded corners and smooth shadows. Use a responsive grid layout for flexibility across devices.
- Smooth and subtle animations using Framer Motion for a polished user experience. Animated transitions when the UI regenerates and shows in the live preview.
